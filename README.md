# Test task

## Description
github.com has public API to get list of users: "https://api.github.com/users". There are helpfull parameters like "per_page" and "since", check them.
You need to create iOS application that displays list of github users loaded into table. Each row should contain login, profile link (html_url) and avatar preview(100x100).
Tap on user should result in opening list of his followers.

## Requirements
* application should be written in **Swift** (Swift 3.0 is preferred, but 2.3 will do just fine)
* source code should be available on github.com

## Expectations
* application should allow to browse at least first 100 users
* code is expected to have unified style throughout the project, be clean and readable

## Time limit
Time is up to you. Try not to spend too much time on this task, it does not require super perfect code or overcomplicated architecture.
